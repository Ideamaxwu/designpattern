## Creational Patterns
  - Factory Pattern (e.g., Shape -> Circle, Rectangle, Square)
  - Abstract Factory Pattern (factory of factories, e.g., Shape, Color -> Circle, Square, Red, Green)
  - Singleton Pattern (e.g., create object instance)
  - Builder Pattern (step by step, e.g., MealBuilder -> Burger, Drink)
  - Prototype Pattern (cache duplicate objects, e.g., database connection using clone())
## Structural Patterns
  - Adapter Pattern (a bridge between incompatible interfaces, e.g., MediaPlayer Adapter)
  - Bridge Pattern (decouple)
  - Filter Pattern (chain multiple criteria in a decoupled way)
  - Composite Pattern (group objects, e.g., EmployeesHierarchy)
  - Decorator Pattern (a wrapper to existing class with additional functionality)
  - Facade Pattern
  - Flyweight Pattern (reuse existing objects by storing them)
  - Proxy Pattern
## Behavioral Patterns
  - Chain Pattern (e.g., Logger)
  - Command Pattern
  - Interpreter Pattern (e.g., symble, grammar and expression parsing)
  - Iterator Pattern
  - Madiator Pattern
  - Memento Pattern (restore states, e.g., GameMemento)
  - Observer Pattern (objects in one-to-many relationship to be notified)
  - State Pattern (states in context)
  - Null Pattern 
  - Strategy Pattern (e.g., algorithm)
  - Template Pattern
  - Visitor Pattern (e.g., algorithm execution)

## J2EE Patterns
  - MVC Pattern
  - BusinessDelegate Pattern
  - CompositeEntity Pattern
  - DataAccessObject Pattern (e.g., database manipulation)
  - FrontController Pattern (a centralized handler, e.g., PageNavigation)
  - InterceptingFilter Pattern (pre-processing and post-processing)
  - ServiceLocator Pattern
  - TransferObject Pattern (POJO)
